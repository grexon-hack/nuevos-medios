This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.5.

The application was created for users who publish advertising content, such as news or relevant topics that may interest the general public.
when starting the user can interact with the published topics and look at the details of said topics,
If the user wants to interact more with the application, he must log in, so that his data is stored in the firebase database.
a new user must register their data, when doing so they must go to their email to validate their entry to the platform after that you can enter.

Upon entering after logging in and having validated their information, the user will be able to create their own publications and store them in 
their own component, and in turn will also be able to delete them.
